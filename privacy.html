MeshLab will automatically check for the availability of updated versions and will notify the need of upgrading the software to the users. For this reason, from time to time, MeshLab will issue a http network connection. If you prefer that MeshLab does not communicate in any way with its developers, simply use a plain firewall and prevent any MeshLab access to the network. This will not limit in any way the normal behaviour of MeshLab. When using MeshLab some aggregated statistical data about only the specific usage of MeshLab are collected: the number and size of the opened/saved meshes; nothing more. Periodically this information is sent back to the developers. This data will be used for statistical analysis only. <br><br>
Paranoids can also look at the sources for seeing what is transmitted.<br><br>

We would like to remark that the kind of aggregated information collected by MeshLab is probably by far less sensitive than the information that is silently collected by most web sites when you surf them: ip address, visited pages, frequency of return. We would also like to stress that we really need this information in order to assess how diffusely MeshLab is used and what is its impact on the 3D community. <br><br>

Thanks for your patience. <br>
The Developers.<br>
