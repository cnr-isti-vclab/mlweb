MeshLab implements a fine tuned ICP one-to-one alignment step, followed by a global bundle adjustment error-distribution step. The alignment can be performed on meshes and point clouds coming from several sources, including active (both short- and long-range) scanners and 3D-from-image tools.'

MeshLab offers different ways to simplify (decimate) triangulated surfaces, able to preserve geometrical detail and texture mapping, or to selectively reduce the number of points in a pointcloud. In other cases, the user may want to increase the number of triangles (or points): MeshLab also provides different subdivision schemes, remeshing and resampling filters to increase geometric complexity of 3D models, or to optimize point distribution and triangulation quality.'
